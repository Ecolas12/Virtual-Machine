The program Vm.c is to simulate the fetch and execute cycle in a p machine.

To run on Eustis, first compile by entering in the command line $ gcc Vm.c
After that it will create an a.out file.
In the command line, enter ./a.out followed by the file name so it should look like this $ ./a.out test.txt.

The program should run and display (directly to the terminal) the op code, pc,bp, and sp pointer, and the values of the stack at that point in the program.
